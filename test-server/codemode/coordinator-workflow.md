# memory-journal-mcp Code Mode Testing Coordinator Workflow

> **This document is optimized for an autonomous agent acting as a Coordinator.**

This guide instructs the Coordinator agent on how to run the `memory-journal-mcp` Code Mode test suite using subagents.

## Goal

Systematically execute all Code Mode tests in `test-server/codemode/` to verify sandbox isolation, workflow orchestration, payload optimization, and error handling. You will delegate testing to subagents, ensuring high-fidelity results and structured error handling, while compiling telemetry.

## Workflow Rules

1. **Sequential Execution**: Tests MUST be executed sequentially (one subagent at a time) according to the Dependency DAG below. Parallel execution may cause conflicts or server instability.
2. **Subagent Delegation**:
   - Use the `invoke_subagent` tool to spawn a `self` subagent for each test file.
   - Provide the exact path to the test file as the subagent's prompt, along with these execution requirements.
3. **Local Verification**:
   - If you or a subagent modifies the codebase, you MUST run the full validation pipeline (`pnpm run check`) locally, and ensure they all pass completely cleanly **BEFORE** committing.
   - **Quality Gates**: Pay strict attention to ESLint and TypeScript compiler outputs. You MUST fix all `pnpm run check` validation issues prior to committing. Do NOT ignore warnings or errors. Follow strict TypeScript guidelines: NEVER use `any` (use `unknown` with type guards), avoid unsafe typecasts, and ensure explicit return types.
   - **WARNING**: Do NOT commit your code and then attempt to use `git commit --amend` to fix a lingering lint or test issue later. Amending a commit rewrites the commit SHA, which will permanently break the changelog tracking workflow.
   - DO NOT perform live server verification. DO NOT wait for a server restart. DO NOT pause or send a message asking the user to refresh the server.
   - The user will verify the live fixes in a completely new run/pass in a separate thread.
4. **Commit**:
   - Once all local tests pass, the subagent MUST commit their codebase changes locally (`git commit -m "..."`). If no modifications were needed, no commit is required.
   - Once the subagent completes, record their final token estimate and metric telemetry, mark the task as done, and move to the next test in the queue.
5. **Code Mode Constraints (P401)**:
   - Ensure subagents explicitly check that Code Mode scripts do NOT leak raw MCP exceptions, returning `{ success: false }` for domain errors.
   - **Tool Availability Warning**: If any tools are unavailable during testing for any reason, the subagent MUST immediately warn the user. We want to actively test the tools, not just their graceful degradation.
6. **Coordinator Progress Reporting**:
   - The Coordinator MUST provide the user with clear, frequent progress reports. After each subagent finishes, emit a message like: "Test pass 4 out of X completed."
   - The Coordinator MUST keep a running tally of how many total issues were fixed by the subagents.

## Test Sequence Queue (Dependency DAG)

To avoid context exhaustion, the test queue has been split into multiple parts:

- [Part 1: Core & Search (1-17)](coordinator-workflow-part-1.md)
- [Part 2: GitHub, IO, Admin, Backup (18-28)](coordinator-workflow-part-2.md)
- [Part 3: Team, Errors, Optimization, Config (29-54)](coordinator-workflow-part-3.md)

Please execute the parts in order.

## Telemetry Collection

When the suite finishes, compile the **Total Token Estimate** and resource metrics (e.g., `memory://metrics/summary`) from all subagents into a final report for the user. Also, report the **Total Number of Issues Fixed** during the entire suite.
