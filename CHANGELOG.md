### Fixed
- **Missing GitHub Issues Implementation** - Fixed incomplete `github_issues` field in models
  - Was referenced in `ContextData` but never populated
  - Now fully implemented with API functions, caching, and context integration

### Technical Details
- **New API Functions** (in `src/github/api.py`):
  - `get_repo_issues()` - Fetch repository issues with caching
  - `get_issue_details()` - Get detailed issue information
  - `get_repo_pull_requests()` - Fetch repository PRs with caching
  - `get_pr_details()` - Get detailed PR information including stats
  - `get_pr_from_branch()` - Find PR by head branch name
  - `_parse_linked_issues()` - Extract issue references from PR bodies
  - All functions include `gh` CLI fallbacks for environments without `requests` library
- **Database Schema Changes**:
  - Added `issue_number`, `issue_url` columns to `memory_journal` table
  - Added `pr_number`, `pr_url`, `pr_status` columns to `memory_journal` table
  - Created indexes for efficient filtering: `idx_memory_journal_issue_number`, `idx_memory_journal_pr_number`
  - Automatic migrations run on server startup
- **New Models** (in `src/models.py`):
  - `GitHubIssueDict` - Type definition for issue data

  - Updated `EntryDict` with issue and PR fields
  - Updated `ContextData` with `github_issues`, `current_pr`, `github_pull_requests` fields
- **Branch Name Patterns** - Auto-detection supports:
  - `issue-123`, `issue/123`, `fix/issue-456`
  - `#123` (shorthand)
  - `/123-` or `/123/` patterns
- **Backward Compatibility** - All new fields are optional; existing databases migrate seamlessly

## [2.0.1] - 2025-10-28

### Fixed - Windows Platform Support

  - **New database column**: `share_with_team` (integer, default 0) in `memory_journal` table
  - **Automatic schema migration**: Existing databases updated automatically

  - Copy entries to team database
  - Query team entries with filters (tags, date range, entry type)
  - Git status checking for synchronization
  - Entry count and statistics
- **Enhanced Search**: All search operations automatically query both personal and team databases
  - `search_entries` - Returns combined results with team indicator (ðŸ‘¥)
  - `search_by_date_range` - Includes team entries in date-based queries
  - Results show source (personal vs team) for clarity
- **New Resource**: `memory://team/recent` - Access recent team-shared entries
  - Returns JSON with team entry count and formatted entries
  - Marked with `source: team_shared` for identification
- **Enhanced Tool**: `create_entry` gains `share_with_team` parameter
  - Set to `true` to copy entry to team database
  - Confirmation message shows sharing status
  - Preserves all entry data (tags, significance, relationships, GitHub Projects)

### Changed - Major Refactoring

## [1.2.2] - 2025-10-26

### Security
- **URL Parsing Vulnerability Fix (CodeQL #110, #111)** - Fixed incomplete URL substring sanitization in GitHub remote URL parsing
  - **Impact**: Prevented potential URL spoofing attacks where malicious URLs could bypass GitHub hostname checks
  - **Root Cause**: Used substring checks (`'github.com' in url`) instead of proper URL parsing
  - **Fix**: Implemented proper `urllib.parse.urlparse()` validation with exact hostname matching
  - **Details**:
    - SSH URLs: Explicit prefix validation with `startswith('git@github.com:')`
    - HTTPS/HTTP URLs: Parse with `urlparse()` and verify `hostname == 'github.com'`
    - Prevents bypasses like `http://evil.com/github.com/fake` or `http://github.com.evil.com/fake`
  - **Severity**: Medium (limited to Git remote URL parsing in local repository context)
  - **Reference**: [CWE-20: Improper Input Validation](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html)

## [1.2.1] - 2025-10-26

### Fixed

  - Moved ML dependency imports to module-level initialization
  - Eliminated async lock deadlock during model loading
  - First semantic search call now completes in <1 second (previously could timeout)
- **Thread pool optimization** - Increased worker count from 2 to 4 to prevent contention during ML model loading

### Changed
- Improved initialization progress messages with step-by-step feedback (Step X/3)
- Added explicit stderr flushing for real-time progress updates

## [1.2.0] - 2025-10-26
